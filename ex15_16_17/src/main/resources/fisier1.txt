Writer Franz Kafka was the eldest son of an upper middle-class Jewish family who was born on July 3, 1883, in Prague,
the capital of Bohemia, a kingdom that was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Tragedy shaped the Kafka home. Franz's two younger brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy by the time Kafka was
six, leaving the boy the only son in a family that included three daughters (all of whom would later die in Nazi death
camps or a Polish ghetto).
Kafka had a difficult relationship with both of his parents. His mother, Julie, was a devoted homemaker who lacked the
intellectual depth to understand her son's dreams to become a writer. Kafka's father, Hermann, had a forceful
personality that often overwhelmed the Kafka home. He was a success in business, making his living retailing men's and
women's clothes.
Kafka's father had a profound impact on both Kafka's life and writing. He was a tyrant of sorts, with a wicked temper
and little appreciation for his son's creative side. Much of Kafka's personal struggles, in romance and other
relationships, came, he believed, in part from his complicated relationship with his father. In his literature, Kafka's
characters were often coming up against an overbearing power of some kind, one that could easily break the will of men
and destroy their sense of self-worth.
Kafka seems to have derived much of his value directly from to his family, in particular his father. For much of his
adult life, he lived within close proximity to his parents.
